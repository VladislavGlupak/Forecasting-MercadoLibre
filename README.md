# Forecasting-MercadoLibre

This repository represents the researching if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

---

## Approach

Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic

Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality

Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet

Step 5: Forecast revenue by using time series models

## Technologies

This project leverages the following tools for financial analysis:

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) - source package management system and environment management system.

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) - Python library thatâ€™s designed specifically for data analysis.

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) - For running and review Python-based programs.

- [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) - is a procedure for forecasting time series data (created by Facebook).

## Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic

![App's prompts](Images/patterns.JPG)

```
Traffic_may_2020 value is 38181
Median_monthly_traffic value is 35172.5
```

Comparing traffic in May and the median for the entire period, we can say that traffic in May increased.

## Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality

I can say that Saturday afternoon traffic is somewhat lower than other days. This is especially pronounced from 8 am to 7 pm. Apparently it's because it's a holiday.
